# Red - Black Tree 

- Red Black Tree is a Binary Search Tree in which every node is colored either **RED or BLACK**.
- A binary tree is said to be balanced if, the difference between the heights of left and right subtrees of every node in the tree is either **-1, 0 or +1**. 
- In an AVL tree, every node maintains an extra information known as balance factor. 
              **Balance factor = heightOfLeftSubtree - heightOfRightSubtree**
