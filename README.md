# AVL-Tree

- AVL tree is a **height-balanced binary search tree**.
- A binary tree is said to be balanced if, the difference between the heights of left and right subtrees of every node in the tree is either **-1, 0 or +1**. 
- In an AVL tree, every node maintains an extra information known as balance factor. 
              **Balance factor = heightOfLeftSubtree - heightOfRightSubtree**
               
Example of AVL Tree

The above tree is a binary search tree and every node is satisfying balance factor condition. So this tree is said to be an AVL tree.
**AVL Tree Rotations**
- In AVL tree, after performing operations like insertion and deletion we need to check the balance factor of every node in the tree.
- If every node satisfies the balance factor condition then we conclude the operation otherwise we must make it balanced. 
- Rotation operations are used to make the tree balanced.
<p>There are four rotations and they are classified into two types.</p>
