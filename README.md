# AVL-Tree
AVL tree is a height-balanced binary search tree. That means, an AVL tree is also a binary search tree but it is a balanced tree. 
A binary tree is said to be balanced if, the difference between the heights of left and right subtrees of every node in the tree is either -1, 0 or +1. 
In other words, a binary tree is said to be balanced if the height of left and right children of every node differ by either -1, 0 or +1. In an AVL tree, every node maintains an extra information known as balance factor. The AVL tree was introduced in the year 1962 by G.M. Adelson-Velsky and E.M. Landis.
