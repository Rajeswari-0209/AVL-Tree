# AVL-Tree
AVL tree is a **height-balanced binary search tree**. That means, an AVL tree is also a binary search tree but it is a balanced tree. 
A binary tree is said to be balanced if, the difference between the heights of left and right subtrees of every node in the tree is either **-1, 0 or +1**. 
In an AVL tree, every node maintains an extra information known as balance factor. 
               **Balance factor = heightOfLeftSubtree - heightOfRightSubtree**
