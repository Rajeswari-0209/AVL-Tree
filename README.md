# AVL-Tree
* Bullet list
AVL tree is a **height-balanced binary search tree**.
A binary tree is said to be balanced if, the difference between the heights of left and right subtrees of every node in the tree is either **-1, 0 or +1**. 
In an AVL tree, every node maintains an extra information known as balance factor. 
              **Balance factor = heightOfLeftSubtree - heightOfRightSubtree**
